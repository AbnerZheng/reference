### **RChain Announces First Blockchain Governance Conference - February 2018 **

The RChain Cooperative will be hosting its first Blockchain Governance conference February 15th-18th, 2018. Full agenda agenda and location will be announced shortly. 

What's Blockchain Governance? 

"Blockchain Governance" can be described as the process's for consensus building on a given distributed network, that includes the network's political/socioeconomic dynamics. It requires technical acumen as well as consensus building models.  

An example of such a decision was, "The DAO just got hacked, should we hard fork?"

The subjects need for dedicated research groups is made apparent when major decisions such as this are thrust onto a community, abruptly, and with major stakes on the line. But the subject is more broad reaching then rallying against malicious actors. Examples of that are contentious hard forks that arent because of bad actors, but are still the cause of passionate discourse, such as the segwit fork on the Bitcoin protocol. 

RChain Board Member and notable Casper PoS lead, Vlad Zamfir had this summary(tweet) of governance in a recent post [Some thoughts on blockchain governance](https://medium.com/@Vlad_Zamfir/some-thoughts-on-blockchain-governance-4b88e63d4e64)

"So governance may just be a a process of persuasion and discovering what your peers believe in order to compromise and have enough consensus ...to implement a change that is perceived to be valuable at some acceptable level of risk"

One of the key action items for this conference (a Vlad recommendation) is the drafting of a principle set that will be formalized into, what we are calling, _The Declaration of Interdependence_. 

This document will describe the RChain's 



*   approach to Blockchain Governance
*   use of Casper Proof-of-stake consensus protocol, 
*   approach to community governance
*   the use of the platform.coop models and decision making process' derived from sociocracy and other experimental governance/DAO models. 

We aim to answer important concerns such as "what constitutes a quorum and whether abstention or "no" is the default choice. "

Look forward to more details and RSVP information. 

On the not of consensus building, The Correct-by-Construction Casper work is going very well. 

In a recent hangout Michael Birch, RChain CBC-Casper dev,  [describes a Casper simulation he is running on three nodes. ](https://youtu.be/TZrlafhHm0E?t=14m40s)

A full post has been drafted with feedback from prominent members of the research community. Look forward to the release of that content, as well as much more, starting early January all throughout the Mercury release and beyond.
